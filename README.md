  ## Description
  The purpose of this project was to design a functional multiple choice quiz about coding. As the user answers questions, the page transitions to the next question. When the quiz is over or when the timer is at zero, the game is over and the user can input his or her initials and save a high score. These scores are in local storage, so that the user can view previous scores again even after the page has been refreshed.

2. The quiz is multiple choice and once you select your answer: "Correct!" or "Wrong!" will flash quickly below the answer buttons. After you answer the first question it will move on to the second question and so on until you either answer all the questions or the timer runs out.If you answer incorrectly a penelty of 15 seconds will be taken off the timer. When you answer correctly no extra time is subtracted and you gain one point.

 At the top left of the home page is the highscore button. Clicking that will take you to the highscore list. There you will find the list of scores with the initials of the person who recieved that score. This is also tied to local storage so if you take the quiz again and get a different score your first score will still be in the higscore list.
